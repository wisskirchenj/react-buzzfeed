# Inspired by a CodeCampTutorial on UTube

My first simple React-Typescript based frontend project, that is served with a file-based json-server backend.

## Technology / External Libraries

- React 18.2.0
- Typescript 4.9.5
- json-server backend
- CSS - plain vanilla

## Repository Contents

The sources of the project - testing may come up too.

## Program description
A toy project, that reads Quiz data as a Json structure from a db.json file and serves it via json-server module as backend (running on port 8000) to the React frontend running on port 3000. The images are taken - and appropriately credited, I hope - from Unsplash. 

Currently two lifestyle questions are setup - the button functionality and evaluation to some lifestyle result is still to come up ...

Have fun!
